Overview
Redesigned difficulty progression from speed-based to quantity-based enemy scaling.

Changes Made
Enemy Size Reduction

Previous: 36×36 pixels
New: 24×24 pixels
Rationale: Smaller enemies allow for more on-screen without overwhelming visual clutter. Makes individual enemies less threatening, compensating for increased numbers.

Starting Enemy Count

Previous: 3 enemies
New: 2 enemies
Rationale: Lower starting difficulty provides gentler learning curve. Players can learn movement mechanics before facing dense enemy patterns.

Enemy Speed

Previous: Fixed at spawn

Horizontal: ±220 pixels/second
Vertical: ±180 pixels/second


New: Consistent ranges (no speed increase over time)

Horizontal: 180-220 pixels/second (random)
Vertical: 150-190 pixels/second (random)


Rationale: Maintaining consistent speeds makes enemy behavior predictable. Difficulty comes from numbers and spatial awareness, not reaction time.
Progressive Spawning System

Previous: No additional enemies spawned
New: Time-based spawning

First spawn: 5 seconds after game start
Spawn interval: 5 seconds (initial) → 3 seconds (minimum)
Formula: max(3.0, 5.0 - (alive_time / 30.0))


Rationale:
5-second initial delay gives breathing room
Gradual acceleration (30 seconds to reach minimum) creates smooth difficulty curve
3-second minimum prevents spawn spam while maintaining pressure
Unlimited enemy count creates natural difficulty ceiling
